Unity editor and game scripts used to make [Fugu Games](http://fugugames.com/) and [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl.rocks).

Not under development, anymore, so this is basically an archive (or trash can) of old scripts, some even still in deprecated Unityscript/Javascript.

Only the scripts here are available under the MIT License, the projects and assets were from third-parties (Unity Standard Assets, Unity Asset Store...)
