# Unity scripts

Accumulated Unity editor and game scripts I've used over the years, until a couple of years ago, so some may be out of date (and of course the Javascript/Unityscript is obsolete but here if you want rewrite them), available under the open source MIT License.

Examples of their use are on [Fugu Games](http://fugugames.com/)
